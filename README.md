# Weather App with Flet

This is a simple weather application built using the **Flet** framework and **OpenWeather API**. The app allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name and displays the current temperature, humidity, weather condition, and an associated weather image.

## Features
- **City Search:** Enter the name of a city to get the current weather data.
- **Weather Information:** Displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition for the selected city.
- **Weather Icons:** Based on the weather condition (e.g., mist, rain, snow), different weather images are shown.
- **Simple UI:** The app provides a clean and user-friendly interface for viewing weather data.

## Tech Stack
- **Flet Framework:** A Python framework for building interactive UIs.
- **OpenWeather API:** API used to fetch real-time weather data.
- **Python:** Programming language used to develop the app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can check your Python version by running:
```bash
python --version
```

### Setting up the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulraheem232/Weatherapp-Flet.git
    cd weather-app-flet
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install requests flet
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:8550`.

## Code Overview

### `main(page: Page)`
This function sets up the app, including the layout and functionality. It defines how weather information is fetched and displayed when the user enters a city name.

### `getweather(e)`
This function is called when the user clicks the "Enter" button. It sends a request to the **OpenWeather API** to fetch weather data for the entered city. It then updates the UI with the city name, temperature, humidity, and weather condition. Based on the weather description, it displays a relevant weather image.

### UI Elements
- **TextField (`cityname`)**: A text input field where users can enter the name of the city.
- **Button (`getweatherbtn`)**: A button that triggers the weather data fetching when clicked.
- **Text Widgets**: Display the city name, temperature, humidity, and weather condition.
- **Image (`weatherimage`)**: Displays the appropriate weather image based on the fetched weather description.

### Weather Descriptions and Icons
The app changes the weather image based on the weather description:
- **Mist**: `mist.png`
- **Rain**: `rain.png`
- **Snow**: `snow.png`
- **Wind**: `wind.png`
- **Clear Sky**: `clear.png`
- **Overcast Clouds**: `clouds.png`
- **Drizzle**: `drizzle.png`

## Future Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for cases where the city is not found or the API request fails.
- **Forecasting**: Add support for multi-day weather forecasting.
- **Geolocation**: Implement a feature to get weather data for the user's current location.
- **Styling**: Enhance the styling and UI/UX for a better user experience.
